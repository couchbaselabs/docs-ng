  <title>vBuckets</title>
  <shortdesc>A vBucket is defined as the <i>owner</i> of a subset of the key space of a Couchbase
    cluster. These vBuckets are used to distributed information effectively across a cluster. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The vBucket system is used both for distributing data and for supporting replicas (copies of
      bucket data) on more than one node. vBuckets are not a user-accessible component, but they are
      a critical component of Couchbase Server and are vital to the availability support and elastic
      nature.</p>
    <p>Clients access the information stored in a bucket by communicating directly with the node
      responsible for the corresponding vBucket. This direct access enables clients to communicate
      with the node storing the data, rather than using a proxy or redistribution architecture. The
      result abstracts the physical topology from the logical partitioning of data. This
      architecture gives Couchbase Server elasticity and flexibility </p>
    <p>Every document ID belongs to a vBucket. A mapping function is used to calculate the vBucket
      in which a given document belongs. In Couchbase Server, that mapping function is a hashing
      function that takes a document ID as input and outputs a vBucket identifier. Once the vBucket
      identifier has been computed, a table is consulted to lookup the server that “hosts” that
      vBucket. The table contains one row per vBucket, pairing the vBucket to its hosting server. A
      server appearing in this table can be (and usually is) responsible for multiple vBuckets.</p>
    
    <p>The following diagrams shows how the Key to Server mapping (vBucket map) works.</p>
    
    <p>In this scenario, there are three servers in the cluster and client wants to look up the value of
      KEY using the <codeph>GET</codeph> operation.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The client first hashes the key to calculate the vBucket which owns KEY. In this example,
        the hash resolves to vBucket 8 (vB8). </li>
      <li>By examining the vBucket map, the
        client determines Server C hosts vB8.</li>
      <li>The client sends the <codeph>GET</codeph> operation directly to Server C.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the next scenario, a server added to the original cluster of three. A new node, Server D,
      is added to the cluster and the vBucket Map is updated (during the rebalance operation). The
      updated map is then sent to all the cluster participants including the other nodes, any
      connected “smart” clients, and the Moxi proxy service.</p>
    
    <p>Within the new four-node cluster model, when a client again wants to determine the 
      value of KEY using the <codeph>GET</codeph> operation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The hashing algorithm still resolves to vBucket 8 (vB8).</li>
      <li>The new vBucket Map now maps vBucket 8 to Server D.</li> 
      <li>The client sends the <codeph>GET</codeph> operation directly to Server D.</li>
    </ul>

    <note type="note"> This architecture allows Couchbase Server to cope with changes without using
      the typical RDBMS sharding method. In addition, the architecture differs from the method used
      by <codeph>memcached</codeph>, which uses client-side key hashes to determine the server from
      a defined list. The memcached method requires active management of the list of servers and
      specific hashing algorithms such as Ketama to cope with changes to the topology. </note>
