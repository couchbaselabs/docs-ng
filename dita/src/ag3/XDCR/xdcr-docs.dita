To replicate views and view indexes, manually exchange view definitions between clusters and re-generate the index on the destination cluster.</p><p>Non UTF–8 encodable document IDs on the source cluster are automatically
filtered out and logged. The IDs are not transferred to the remote cluster. If there are any non UTF–8 keys, the warning output, <codeph>xdcr_error.*</codeph> displays in the log files along with a list of all non-UTF–8 keys found by XDCR.</p></body></topic>
