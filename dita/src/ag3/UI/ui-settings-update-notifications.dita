    <p>You can enable or disable Update
      Notifications by checking the <codeph>Enable software update notifications</codeph> checkbox
      within the <codeph>Update Notifications</codeph> screen. Once you have changed the option,
      click <codeph>Save</codeph> to record the change.</p>
    
    <p>If update notifications are
        disabled, then the Update Notifications screen only notifies you of your currently
        installed version, and no alert is provided.</p>

    <p>During installation you can select to enable the Update Notification function. Update
      notifications allow a client accessing the Couchbase Web Console to determine whether a newer
      version of Couchbase Server is available for download.</p>
    <p>If <codeph>Enable software update notifications</codeph> is selected, the web console
      communicates with Couchbase servers to confirm the version number of your Couchbase
      installation. During this process, the client submits the following information to the
      Couchbase server:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The current version of your Couchbase Server installation. 
        When a new version of  Couchbase Server becomes available, 
        you are provided with notification of the new version and information on where to download the new version.</p></li>
      <li><p>Basic information about the size and configuration of your Couchbase cluster. This
        information is used to help Couchbase prioritize development efforts.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can enable/disable software update notifications. 
    The process occurs within the browser accessing the web console, not within the server itself. 
      No further configuration or internet access is required on the server to enable
      this functionality. Providing the client accessing the Couchbase server console has internet
      access, the information can be communicated to the Couchbase servers.</p>
    <p>The update notification process the information anonymously, and the data cannot be tracked.
      The information is only used to provide you with update notification and to provide
      information that will help improve future development process for Couchbase Server and
      related products.</p>
    <note type="note">If the browser or computer that you are using to connect to your Couchbase Server web console
      does not have Internet access, the update notification system does not work.</note>
