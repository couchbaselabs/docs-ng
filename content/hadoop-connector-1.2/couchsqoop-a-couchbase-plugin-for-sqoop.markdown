# Couchbase Hadoop Connector

<a id="hadoop-connector-preface"></a>

## Introduction

This connector allows you to connect to Couchbase Server 2.5 or 3.0 to
stream keys into HDFS or Hive for processing with Hadoop. If you have used
Sqoop before with other databases then using this connector should be
straightforward since it uses a similar command line argument structure.
Some arguments will seem slightly different as Couchbase has a very
different structure than a typical RDBMS.
