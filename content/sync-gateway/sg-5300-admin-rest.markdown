## Admin REST API

The Admin REST API is a superset of the Sync REST API with the following major extensions:

* The capability to view, create, and modify users and roles.
* The capability to perform management tasks such as creating and deleting databases.
* The capability to perform administrative tasks without authentication.  The Admin REST API operates in superuser mode—you can view and modify anything without needing a password or session cookie.

By default, the Admin REST API runs on port 4985 (unless you change the `adminInterface` configuration parameter). **Do not expose this port**—It belongs behind your firewall. Anyone who can reach this port has free access to and control over your databases and user accounts.


### Admin REST API Endpoints

`PUT /$DB/` -- Configures a new database. The body of the request contains the database configuration as a JSON object ()the same as an entry in the `databases` property of a configuration file. Note that this doesn't create a Couchbase Server bucket—you need to do that before configuring the database.

`DELETE /$DB/` -- Removes a database. It doesn't delete the Couchbase Server bucket or any of its data, though, so you could bring the database back later with a PUT.

`/$DB/_user/$name` -- represents a user account. It supports GET, PUT, and DELETE, and you can also POST to `/$DB/_user/`. The body is a JSON object; for details see the [[Authentication]] page. The special user name `GUEST` applies to unauthenticated requests.

`/$DB/_role/$name` -- represents a role. This API is similar to users.

`/$DB/_session` -- POST to this endpoint to create a logon session. The request body is a JSON object containing the username in the `name` object and the duration of the session (in seconds) in the `ttl` object. The response is a JSON object with properties `session_id` (the session cookie string), `expires` (the time the session expires) and `cookie_name` (the name of the HTTP cookie to set).

`/_compact` -- Compacts a database by removing obsolete document bodies. Needs to be run occasionally.

`/_profile` -- POST to this endpoint to enable Go CPU profiling, which can be useful for diagnosing performance problems. To start profiling, send a JSON body with a `file` property whose value is a path to write the profile to. To stop profiling, send a request without a `file` property.

### Tips

A quick way to tell whether you're talking to the Admin REST API is by sending a `GET /` request and checking whether the resulting object contains an `"ADMIN": true` property.

[HTTP requests logged to the console](#command-line-tool) show the user name of the requester after the URL. If the request is made on the admin port, this is "(ADMIN)" instead.
