# Installing and Upgrading

To start using Couchbase Server, you need to follow these steps:

 1. Make sure your machine meets the system requirements. See
    [Preparation](#couchbase-getting-started-prepare).

 1. Install Couchbase Server. See [Installing Couchbase
    Server](#couchbase-getting-started-install).

 1. For more information on Upgrading Couchbase Server from a previous version, see
    [Upgrading to Couchbase Server 2.0.x](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade).

 1. Test the installation by connecting and storing some data using the native
    Memcached protocol. See [Testing Couchbase
    Server](#couchbase-getting-started-testing).

 1. Setup the new Couchbase Server system by completing the web-based setup
    instructions. See [Initial Server Setup](#couchbase-getting-started-setup).

## Preparation

Mixed deployments, meaning deployments with both Linux and Windows server nodes
are not supported at this time. When you deploy to multiple operating systems
you should use same operating system on all machines.

A Couchbase cluster with nodes on different operating systems will not function
with one another due to differences in the number of shards. Therefore using
multiple platforms within a cluster is not a supported configuration.

Due to limitations within the Mac OS X operating system, the Mac OS X
implementation is incompatible with other operating systems. It is not possible
either to mix operating systems within the same cluster, or configure XDCR
between a Mac OS X and Windows or Linux cluster.

Your system should meet or exceed the following system requirements.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-prepare-platforms"></a>

### Supported Platforms

 * RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (32-bit and 64-bit) – RedHat 5.8 recommended

 * CentOS 5 and 6 (32-bit and 64-bit) – 5.8 recommended. Later CentOS versions may
   work, but are unsupported. You may need to install a specific OpenSSL dependency
   by running:

    ```
    root-shell> yum install openssl098e
    ```

 * [Amazon AMI (32-bit and
   64-bit)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile/ref=dtl_pcp_sold_by?ie=UTF8&id=1a064a14-5ac2-4980-9167-15746aabde72)

 * Ubuntu Linux 10.04 (32-bit and 64-bit) for production

 * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 (32-bit and 64-bit) *for production. Recommended.*

 * Ubuntu Linux 13.04 may work, but is unsupported. You may need to install a
   specific OpenSSL dependency by running:

    ```
    root-shell> apt-get install libssl0.9.8
    ```

   ### About SELinux

   Couchbase Server does not currently operate when SELinux is enabled. You should
   disable SELinux on each node in the cluster to prevent problems with the
   operation of Couchbase Server. For more information on disable SELinux, see [How
   to Disable SELinux](http://www.crypt.gen.nz/selinux/disable_selinux.html).

 * Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (64-bit). You must upgrade your
   Windows Server 2008 R2 installation with Service Pack 1 installed before running
   Couchbase Server. You can obtain Service Pack 1 from <a href=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/gg635126.aspx>Microsoft TechNet</a>.

 * Windows 7 (64-bit).

 * Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.8 (64-bit only) for *Developer Only*. Not supported in
   production. Couchbase Server on Mac OSX uses 64 vBuckets as opposed to the 1024
   vBuckets used by other platforms. Due to this difference, if you need to move
   data between a Mac OS X cluster and a cluster hosted on another platform, please
   use `cbbackup` and `cbrestore`. For more information, see [Backup and Restore
   Between Mac OS X and Other Platforms](#couchbase-backup-restore-mac).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-prepare-hardware"></a>

### Hardware Requirements

The following hardware requirements are recommended for installation:

 * Quad-core for key-value store, 64-bit CPU running at 3GHz

 * Six cores if you use XDCR and views.

 * 16GB RAM (physical)

 * Block-based storage device (hard disk, SSD, EBS, iSCSI). Network filesystems
   (e.g. CIFS, NFS) are not supported.

A minimum specification machine should have the following characteristics:

 * Dual-core CPU running at 2GHz for key-value store

 * 4GB RAM (physical)

For development and testing purposes a reduced CPU and RAM than the minimum
specified can be used. This can be as low as 1GB of free RAM beyond operating
system requirements and a single CPU core.

However, you should not use a configuration lower than that specified above in
production. Performance on machines lower than the minimum specification will be
significantly lower and should not be used as an indication of the performance
on a production machine.

View performance on machines with less than 2 CPU cores will be significantly
reduced.

You must have enough memory to run your operating system and the memory reserved
for use by Couchbase Server. For example, if you want to dedicate 8GB of RAM to
Couchbase Server you must have enough RAM to host your operating system. If you
are running additional applications and servers, you will need additional RAM.
For smaller systems, such as those with less than 16GB you should for instance
you should allocate at least 40% of RAM to your operating system.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-prepare-storage"></a>

### Storage Requirements

You must have the following storage available:

 * 1GB for application logging

 * At least twice the disk space to match your physical RAM for persistence of
   information

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-prepare-browser"></a>

### Supported Web Browsers

The Couchbase Web Console runs on the following browsers, with Javascript
support enabled:

 * Mozilla Firefox 3.6 or higher

   To enable JavaScript, select the `Enable JavaScript` option within the `Content`
   panel of the application preferences.

 * Safari 5 or higher

   To enable JavaScript, use the checkbox on the security tab of the application
   preferences.

 * Google Chrome 11 or higher

   To enable JavaScript, use the `Allow all sites to run JavaScript (recommended)`
   option within the `Content` button of the `Under the Hood` section of the
   application preferences.

 * Internet Explorer 8 or higher

   To enable JavaScript, by enabling `Active Scripting` within the `Custom Level`,
   section of the `Security` section of the `Internet Options` item of the `Tools`
   menu.

<a id="couchbase-network-ports"></a>

### Network Ports

Couchbase Server uses a number of different network ports for communication
between the different components of the server, and for communicating with
clients that accessing the data stored in the Couchbase cluster. The ports
listed must be available on the host for Couchbase Server to run and operate
correctly. Couchbase Server will configure these ports automatically, but you
must ensure that your firewall or IP tables configuration allow communication on
the specified ports for each usage type. On Linux the installer will notify you
that you need to open these ports.

The following table lists the ports used for different types of communication
with Couchbase Server, as follows:

 * **Node to Node**

   Where noted, these ports are used by Couchbase Server for communication between
   all nodes within the cluster. You must have these ports open on all to enable
   nodes to communicate with each other.

 * **Node to Client**

   Where noted, these ports should be open between each node within the cluster and
   any client nodes accessing data within the cluster.

 * **Cluster Administration**

   Where noted, these ports should be open and accessible to allow administration,
   whether using the REST API, command-line clients, and Web browser.

 * **XDCR**

   Ports are used for XDCR communication between all nodes in both the source and
   destination clusters.

## Installing Couchbase Server

To install Couchbase Server on your machine you must download the appropriate
package for your chosen platform from
[http://www.couchbase.com/downloads](http://www.couchbase.com/downloads). For
each platform, follow the corresponding platform-specific instructions.

If you are installing Couchbase Server on to a machine that has previously had
Couchbase Server installed and you do not want to perform an upgrade
installation, you must remove Couchbase Server and any associated data from your
machine before you start the installation. For more information on uninstalling
Couchbase Server, see [Uninstalling Couchbase Server](#couchbase-uninstalling).

To perform an upgrade installation while retaining your existing dataset, see
[Upgrading to Couchbase Server 2.0.x](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-install-redhat"></a>

### Red Hat Linux Installation

The RedHat installation uses the RPM package. Installation is supported on
RedHat and RedHat based operating systems such as CentOS.

To install, use the `rpm` command-line tool with the RPM package that you
downloaded. You must be logged in as root (Superuser) to complete the
installation:


```
root-shell> rpm --install couchbase-server version.rpm
```

Where `version` is the version number of the downloaded package.

Once the `rpm` command completes, Couchbase Server starts automatically, and is
configured to automatically start during boot under the 2, 3, 4, and 5
runlevels. Refer to the RedHat RPM documentation for more information about
installing packages using RPM.

Once installation finishes, the installation process will display a message
similar to that below:


```

To continue installation you open a web browser and access the Couchbase Web
Console. See [Initial Server Setup](#couchbase-getting-started-setup).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-install-ubuntu"></a>

### Ubuntu Linux Installation

The Ubuntu installation uses the DEB package. To install, use the `dpkg`
command-line tool using the DEB file that you downloaded. The following example
uses `sudo` which will require root-access to allow installation:


```
shell> dpkg -i couchbase-server version.deb
```

Where `version` is the version number of the downloaded package.

Once the `dpkg` command has been executed, the Couchbase server starts
automatically, and is configured to automatically start during boot under the 2,
3, 4, and 5 runlevels. Refer to the Ubuntu documentation for more information
about installing packages using the Debian package manager.

documentation for instructions. To continue installation you must open a web
browser and access the web administration interface. See [Initial Server
Setup](#couchbase-getting-started-setup).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-install-win"></a>

### Microsoft Windows Installation

To install on Windows, download the Windows installer package. This is supplied
as a Windows executable. You can install the package either using the wizard, or
by doing an unattended installation process. In either case make sure that you
have no anti-virus software running on the machine before you start the
installation process. You also need administrator privileges on the machine
where you install it.

### Port Exhaustion on Windows

The TCP/IP port allocation on Windows by default includes a restricted number of
ports available for client communication. For more information on this issue,
including information on how to adjust the configuration and increase the
available ports, see <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx>MSDN: Avoiding TCP/IP Port Exhaustion</a>.

Couchbase Server uses the Microsoft C++ redistributable package, which will
automatically download for you during installation. However, if another
application on your machine is already using the package, your installation
process may fail. To ensure that your installation process completes
successfully, shut down all other running applications during installation.

**Installation Wizard**

 1. Double click on the downloaded executable file.

    The installer for windows will detect if any redistributable packages included
    with Couchbase need to be installed or not. If these packaged are not already on
    your system, the install will automatically install them along with Couchbase
    Server.

 1. Follow the install wizard to complete the installation.

    You will be prompted with the `Installation Location` screen. You can change the
    location where the Couchbase Server application is located. Note that this does
    not configure the location of where the persistent data will be stored, only the
    location of the server itself.

    The install will copy the necessary files to the system. During the installation
    process, the installer will also check to ensure that the default administration
    port is not already in use by another application. If the default port is
    unavailable, the installer will prompt for a different port to be used for
    administration of the Couchbase server.

After installation you should follow the server setup instructions. See [Initial
Server Setup](#couchbase-getting-started-setup).

**Unattended Installation**

To use the unattended installation process, you first record your installation
settings in wizard installation. These settings are saved to a file. You can use
this file to silently install other nodes of the same version.

To record your install options, open a Command Terminal or Powershell and start
the installation executable with the `/r` command-line option:


```
shell> couchbase_server_version.exe /r /f1your_file_name.iss
```

You will be prompted with installation options, and the wizard will complete the
server install. A file with your options will be recorded at
`C:\Windows\your_file_name.iss`.

To perform an installation using this recorded setup file, copy the
`your_file_name.iss` file into the same directory as the installer executable.
Run the installer from the command-line using the `/s` option:


```
shell> couchbase_server_version.exe /s -f1your_file_name.iss
```

You can repeat this process on multiple machines by copying the install package
and the `your_file_name.iss` file to the same directory on each machine.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-install-macosx"></a>

### Mac OS X Installation

Couchbase Server on Mac OS X is for development purposes only.

Please use the default archive file hander in Mac OS X, Archive Utility, when
you unpack the Couchbase Server distribution. It is more difficult to diagnose
non-functioning or damaged installations after extraction by other third party
archive extraction tools.

The Mac OS X installation uses a Zip file which contains a standalone
application that can be copied to the `Applications` folder or to any other
location you choose. The installation location is not the same as the location
of the Couchbase data files.

Due to limitations within the Mac OS X operating system, the Mac OS X
implementation is incompatible with other operating systems. It is not possible
either to mix operating systems within the same cluster, or configure XDCR
between a Mac OS X and Windows or Linux cluster.

If you need to move data between a Mac OS X cluster and a cluster hosted on
another platform, please use `cbbackup` and `cbrestore`. For more information,
see [Backup and Restore Between Mac OS X and Other
Platforms](#couchbase-backup-restore-mac).

To install:

 1. Delete any previous installs of Couchbase Server at the command line or by
    dragging the icon to the Trash can.

 1. Remove remaining files from previous installations:

     ```
     > rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Couchbase

     >rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Membase
     ```

 1. Download the Mac OS X Zip file.

 1. Double-click the downloaded Zip installation file to extract the server. This
    will create a single folder, the `Couchbase Server.app` application.

 1. Drag and Drop `Couchbase Server.app` to your chosen installation folder, such as
    the system `Applications` folder.

Once the install completes, you can double-click on `Couchbase Server.app` to
start it. The Couchbase Server icon appears in the menu bar on the right-hand
side. If you have not yet configured your server, then the Couchbase Web Console
opens and you should to complete the Couchbase Server setup process. See
[Initial Server Setup](#couchbase-getting-started-setup) for more details.

The Couchbase application runs as a background application. If you click on the
icon in the menu bar you see a list of operations that can be performed.

The command line tools are included in the Couchbase Server application
directory. You can access them in Terminal by using the full path of the
Couchbase Server installation. By default, this is
`/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/`.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-setup"></a>

## Initial Server Setup

We recommend that you clear your browser cache before doing the setup process.
You can find notes and tips on how to do this on different browsers and
platforms on [this page](http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache).

On all platforms you can access the web console by connecting to the embedded
web server on port 8091. For example, if your server can be identified on your
network as `servera`, you can access the web console by opening
`http://servera:8091/`. You can also use an IP address or, if you are on the
same machine, `http://localhost:8091`. If you set up Couchbase Server on another
port other than `8091`, go to that port.

 1. Open Couchbase Web Console.

 1. Set the disk storage and cluster configuration.

    The `Configure Disk Storage` option specifies the location of the persistent
    storage used by Couchbase Server. The setting affects only this node and sets
    the directory where all the data will be stored on disk. This will also set
    where the indices created by views will be stored. If you are not indexing data
    with views you can accept the default setting. For the best performance, you may
    want to configure two different disks for storing your document and index data.

    The `Configure Server Memory` section sets the amount of physical RAM that will
    be allocated by Couchbase Server for storage.

    If you are creating a new cluster, this is the amount of memory that will be
    allocated on each node within your Couchbase cluster. The memory for each node
    in a cluster must be the same amount. You must specify a value that can be
    supported by all the nodes in your cluster as this setting will apply to the
    entire cluster.

    The default value is 60% of your total free RAM. This figure is designed to
    allow RAM capacity for use by the operating system caching layer when accessing
    and using views.

 1. Provide a node IP or hostname under Configure Server Hostname. For more details
    about using hostnames see [Using Hostnames with Couchbase
    Server](#couchbase-getting-started-hostnames).


    ![](images/configure_server1.png)

 1. To join an existing cluster, Click Join a cluster now.

    Provide the IP Address or hostname of an existing node, and administrative
    credentials for that existing cluster.

 1. Click on the name of a sample bucket to load Couchbase Server with sample data.
    This demonstrates Couchbase Server and help you understand and develop views. If
    you decide to install sample data, the installer creates one Couchbase bucket
    for each set of sample data you choose.


    ![](images/web-console-startup-3.png)

    For more information on the contents of the sample buckets, see [Couchbase
    Sample Buckets](#couchbase-sampledata).

 1. Set up a default bucket for Couchbase Server. You can change the bucket settings
    later. Note that you cannot change the bucket name after you create it.

    ### Default Bucket Should Only for Testing

    The default bucket should not be used for storing live application data; you
    should create a bucket specifically for your application. The default bucket
    should only be used for testing.


    ![](images/web-console-startup-4.png)

    The options are:

     * **Bucket Type**

       The type of the bucket, either `Memcached` or `Couchbase`. See [Data
       Storage](#couchbase-introduction-architecture-buckets) for more information. The
       remainder of the options differ based on your selection.

       For `Couchbase` bucket type:

        * **Memory Size**

          The amount of available RAM on this server which should be allocated to the
          bucket.

        * **Replicas**

          For Couchbase buckets you can enable data replication so that the data is copied
          to other nodes in a cluster. You can configure up to three replicas per bucket.
          If you set this to one, you need to have a minimum of two nodes in your cluster
          and so forth. If a node in a cluster fails, after you perform failover, the
          replicated data will be made available on a functioning node. This provides
          continuous cluster operations in spite of machine failure. For more information,
          see [Failing Over Nodes](#couchbase-admin-tasks-failover).

          You can disable replication by deselecting the `Enable` checkbox.

          To configure replicas, Select a number in `Number of replica (backup) copies`
          drop-down list.

          To enable replica indexes, Select the `Index replicas` checkbox. Couchbase
          Server can also create replicas of indexes. This ensures that indexes do not
          need to be rebuilt in the event of a node failure. This will increase network
          load as the index information is replicated along with the data.

        * **Flush**

          To enable the operation for a bucket, click the `Enable` checkbox. Enable or
          disable support for the Flush command, which deletes all the data in an a
          bucket. The default is for the flush operation to be disabled.

       For `Memcached` bucket type:

        * **Memory Size**

          The bucket is configured with a per-node amount of memory. Total bucket memory
          will change as nodes are added/removed.

          For more information, see [RAM Sizing](#couchbase-bestpractice-sizing-ram).

 1. Select `Update Notifications`, and Couchbase Web Console will communicate with
    Couchbase nodes and confirm the version numbers of each node. During this
    process, the client sends the following information to Couchbase Server:

     * The current version. When a new version of Couchbase Server exists, you get
       information on where you can download the new version.

     * Information about the size and configuration of your Couchbase cluster. This
       information helps us prioritize our development efforts.

    As long as you have internet access, the information will be sent. The update
    notification process provides the information anonymously. Couchbase only uses
    this information to provide you with updates and information that will help us
    improve Couchbase Server and related products.

    When you provide an email address we will add it to the Couchbase community
    mailing list, which will provide you with news and update information about
    Couchbase and related products. You can unsubscribe from the mailing list at any
    time using the unsubscribe link provided in each email communication.

 1. Enter a username and password. The password must be at least six characters in
    length. You use these credentials each time you add a new server into the
    cluster. The are also the same credentials for Couchbase REST API. See, [Using
    the REST API](#couchbase-admin-restapi).

Once you finish this setup, you see Couchbase Web Console with the Cluster
Overview page:


![](images/web-console-startup-7.png)

Your server is now running and ready to use. After you install your server and
finish initial setup you can also optionally configure other settings, such as
the port, RAM, using any of the following methods:

 * **Using command-line tools**

   The command line tools provided with your Couchbase Server installation includes
   `couchbase-cli`. This tool provides access to the core functionality of the
   Couchbase Server by providing a wrapper to the REST API. Seecluster
   initialization.

 * **Using the REST API**

   Couchbase Server can be configured and controlled using a REST API. In fact, the
   REST API is the basis for both the command-line tools and Web interface to
   Couchbase Server.

   For more information on using the REST API to provision and setup your node, see
   [Provisioning a Node](#couchbase-admin-restapi-provisioning).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-hostnames"></a>

## Using Hostnames with Couchbase Server

When you first install Couchbase Server you can access using a default IP
address. There may be cases where you want to provide a hostname for each
instance of a server. Each hostname you provide should be a valid one and will
ultimately resolve to a valid IP Address. This section describes how you provide
hostnames on Windows and Linux for the different versions of Couchbase Server.
If you restart a node, it will use the hostname once again. If you failover or
remove a node from a cluster, the node you should configure the hostname once
again.

**In the Cloud (such as EC2, Azure, etc)**. For more information about handling
IP addresses and hostnames, see [Handling Changes in IP
Addresses](#couchbase-bestpractice-cloud-ip).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-hostnames-pre2.0"></a>

### Hostnames for Couchbase Server 2.0.1 and Earlier

For 2.0.1 please follow the same steps for 2.0 and earlier.

**For Linux 2.0.1 and Earlier:**

 1. Install Couchbase Server.

 1. Execute:

     ```
     sudo /etc/init.d/couchbase-server stop
     ```

 1. Edit the `start()` function in the script located at
    `/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-server`.

    Under the line that reads:

     ```
     -run ns_bootstrap -- \
     ```

    Add a new line that reads:

     ```
     -name ns_1@hostname \
     ```

    Where `hostname` is either a DNS name or an IP address that you want this server
    to identify the node (the 'ns\_1@' prefix is mandatory). For example:

     ```
     ...
          -run ns_bootstrap -- \
          -name ns_1@couchbase1.company.com \
          -ns_server config_path "\"/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config\"" \
     ...
     ```

 1. Edit the IP address configuration file.

    This is located at `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/ip`. This file contains the
    identified IP address of the node once it is part of a cluster. Open the file,
    and add a single line containing the `hostname`, as configured in the previous
    step.

 1. Delete the files under:

     * `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data/*`

     * `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/mnesia/*`

     * `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat`

 1. Execute:

     ```
     sudo /etc/init.d/couchbase-server start
     ```

 1. You can see the correctly identified node as the hostname under the Manage
    Servers page. You will again see the setup wizard since the configuration was
    cleared out; but after completing the wizard the node will be properly
    identified.

**For Windows 2.0.1 and Earlier** :

 1. Install Couchbase Server.

 1. Stop the service by running:

     ```
     shell> C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\service_stop.bat
     ```

 1. Unregister the service by running:

     ```
     shell> C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\service_unregister.bat
     ```

 1. For 2.0, edit the script located at
    `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\service_register.bat`.

     * On the 7th line it says: `set NS_NAME=ns_1@%IP_ADDR%`

     * Replace `%IP_ADDR%` with the hostname/IP address that you want to use.

 1. Edit the IP address configuration file.

    Edit `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\ip`. This file
    contains the identified IP address of the node once it is part of a cluster.
    Open the file, and add a single line containing the `hostname`, as configured in
    the previous step.

 1. Register the service by running the modified script:
    `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\service_register.bat`

 1. Delete the files located under:
    `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\mnesia`.

 1. Start the service by running:

     ```
     shell> C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\service_start.bat
     ```

 1. See the node correctly identifying itself as the hostname in the GUI under the
    Manage Servers page. Note you will be taken back to the setup wizard since the
    configuration was cleared out, but after completing the wizard the node will be
    named properly.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade"></a>

## Upgrading to Couchbase Server 2.0.x

The following are officially supported upgrade paths for Couchbase Server for
both online upgrades or offline upgrades:

 * Couchbase 1.8.1 to Couchbase 2.0.x and above
 * Couchbase 2.0 to Couchbase 2.0.x and above

If you want to upgrade from 1.8.0 to 2.0.x, you must have enough disk space
available for both your original Couchbase Server 1.8 data files and the new
format for Couchbase Server 2.0 files. You will also need additional disk space
for new functions such as indexing and compaction. You will need approximately
three times the disk space.

Direct upgrades from Couchbase Server 1.8.0 to 2.0 or earlier releases are not
supported. You must first upgrade to Couchbase Server 1.8.1 to provide data
compatibility with Couchbase Server 2.0 +.

You can perform a cluster upgrade in two ways:

 * **Online Upgrades**

   You can upgrade your cluster without taking your cluster down and so your
   application keeps running during the upgrade process. There are two ways you can
   perform this process: as a standard, rolling online upgrade, or as a swap
   rebalance. Using the standard, rolling upgrade, you take down one or two nodes
   from a cluster, and rebalance so that remaining nodes handle incoming requests.
   This is an approach you use if you have enough remaining cluster capacity to
   handle the nodes you remove and upgrade. You will need to perform rebalance
   twice for every node you upgrade: the first time to move data onto remaining
   nodes, and a second time to move data onto the new nodes. For more information
   about a standard, rolling upgrade, see

   Standard online upgrades may take a while because each node must be taken out of
   the cluster, upgraded to a current version, brought back into the cluster, and
   then rebalanced. However since you can upgrade the cluster without taking it
   cluster down, you may prefer this upgrade method. For instructions on online
   upgrades, see [Online Upgrades](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-online).

   For swap rebalance, you add a note to the cluster then perform a swap rebalance
   to shift data from an old node to a new node. You might prefer this approach if
   you do not have enough cluster capacity to handle data when you remove an old
   node. This upgrade process is also much quicker than performing a standard
   online upgrade because you only need to rebalance each upgraded node once. For
   more information on swap rebalance, see [Swap
   Rebalance](#couchbase-admin-tasks-addremove-rebalance-swap).

 * **Offline Upgrades**

   This type of upgrade must be well-planned and scheduled. For offline upgrades,
   you shut down your application first so that no more incoming data arrives. Then
   you shut down each Couchbase Server node and verify the disk write queue is 0.
   This way you know that Couchbase Server has stored all items onto disk from
   during shutdown. You then perform an install of the latest version of Couchbase
   onto the machine. The installer will automatically detect the files from the
   older install and convert them to the correct format, if needed.

   Offline upgrades can take less time than online upgrades because you can upgrade
   every node in the cluster at once. The cluster must be shut down for the upgrade
   to take place. Both the cluster and all the applications built on it will not be
   available during this time. For full instructions on performing an offline
   upgrade, see [Offline Upgrade
   Process](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-offline).

<a id="table-couchbase-getting-started-upgrade"></a>

Feature                       | Online Upgrades                                 | Offline Upgrades

### Backup your data before performing an upgrade

Before you perform an upgrade, whether it is online or offline, you should
backup your data, see [Backup and Restore](#couchbase-backup-restore).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-online"></a>

### Online Upgrades

This is also known as a standard, rolling upgrade process and it can take place
without taking down the cluster or your application. This means that the cluster
and applications can continue running while you upgrade the individual nodes in
a cluster to the latest Couchbase version.

For information on upgrading from Couchbase Server 1.8 to Couchbase Server 2.0,
see [Upgrades Notes 1.8.1 to 2.0 +](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-1-8-2-0).
Direct upgrades from Couchbase Server 1.8 to 2.0 Beta or earlier releases are
not supported.

To perform an online upgrade of your cluster:

 1. Create a backup of your cluster data using `cbbackup`. See [cbbackup
    Tool](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbbackup).

 1. Choose a node to remove from the cluster and upgrade. You can upgrade one node
    at a time, or if you have enough cluster capacity, two nodes at a time. We do
    not recommend that you remove more than two nodes at a time for this upgrade.

 1. In Couchbase Web Console under `Manage->Server Nodes` screen, click `Remove
    Server`. This marks the server for removal from the cluster, but does not
    actually remove it.


    ![](images/online-upgrade-removenode.png)

 1. The `Pending Rebalance` shows servers that require a rebalance. Click the
    `Rebalance` button next to the node you will remove.


    ![](images/online-upgrade-rebalance.png)

    This will move data from the node to remaining nodes in cluster. Once
    rebalancing has been completed, the `Server Nodes` display should display only
    the remaining, active nodes in your cluster.


    ![](images/online-upgrade-noderemoved.png)

 1. Perform an individual node upgrade to the latest version of Couchbase Server.
    See [Upgrading Individual Nodes](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-individual).

    Couchbase Server starts automatically after the upgrade. You now need to add the
    node back to the cluster.

 1. Open Web Console for an existing node in the cluster.

 1. Go to `Manage->Server Nodes`.

 1. Click the `Add Server` button. You will see a prompt to add a node to the
    cluster.

    *At this point you can provide a hostname for the new node you add. For more
    information, see.*


    ![](images/online-upgrade-addnode.png)

    After you add the new node, the Pending Rebalance count will indicate that
    servers need to be rebalanced into the cluster.

 1. Click `Rebalance` to rebalance the cluster and bring the new node into an active
    state.

Repeat these steps for each node in the cluster in order to upgrade the entire
cluster to a new version.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-online-swap"></a>

### Online Upgrade with Swap Rebalance

You can perform a swap rebalance to upgrade your nodes to Couchbase Server 2.0,
without reducing the performance of your cluster. For general information on
swap rebalance, see [Swap
Rebalance](#couchbase-admin-tasks-addremove-rebalance-swap).

You will need one extra node to perform a swap rebalance.

 1. Install Couchbase Server 2.0 on one extra machine that is not yet in the
    cluster. For install instructions, see [Installing Couchbase
    Server](#couchbase-getting-started-install).

 1. Create a backup of your cluster data using `cbbackup`. See [cbbackup
    Tool](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbbackup).

 1. Open Couchbase Web Console at an existing node in the cluster.

 1. Go to `Manage->Server Nodes`. In the Server panel you can view and managing
    servers in the cluster:


    ![](images/upgrade_addserver.png)

 1. Click Add Server. A panel appears where you can provide credentials and either a
    host name or IP address for the new node: *At this point you can provide a
    hostname for the node you add. For more information, see.*


    ![](images/online-upgrade-addnode.png)

 1. Remove one of your existing old nodes to from the cluster. Under Server Nodes |
    Server panel, Click Remove Server for the node you want to remove. This will
    flag this server for removal:

 1. In the Server panel, click Rebalance.

    The rebalance will automatically take all data from the node flagged for removal
    and move it to your new node.

Repeat these steps for all the remaining old nodes in the cluster. You can add
up to two new nodes at a time and remove two nodes, however you should always
add the same number of nodes from the cluster as you remove. For instance if you
add one node, remove one node and if you add two nodes, you can remove two.

Until you upgrade all nodes in a cluster to Couchbase Server 2.0, any features
in 2.0 will be disabled. This means views or XDCR will not yet function until
you migrate all nodes in your cluster to 2.0. After you do so, they will be
enabled for your use.

For general information on swap rebalance, see [Swap
Rebalance](#couchbase-admin-tasks-addremove-rebalance-swap).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-offline"></a>

### Offline Upgrade Process

The offline upgrade process requires you to shutdown all the applications and
then the entire Couchbase Server cluster. You can then perform the upgrade the
software on each machine, and bring your cluster and application back up again.

If you are upgrade from Couchbase Server 1.8 to Couchbase 2.0 there are more
steps for the upgrade because you must first upgrade to Couchbase 1.8.1 for data
compatibility with 2.0. For more information, see [Upgrades Notes 1.8.1 to 2.0
+](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-1-8-2-0).

Check that your disk write queue ( [Disk Write
Queue](#couchbase-monitoring-diskwritequeue) ) is completely drained before you
remove and upgrade a node. This will ensure that all data has been persisted to
disk and will be available after the upgrade. It is a best practice to turn off
your application and allow the queue to drain before you upgrade it. It is also
a best practice to perform a backup of all data before you upgrade

To perform an offline upgrade:

 1. Shut down your application, so that no more requests go to Couchbase Cluster.

    You can monitor the activity of your cluster by using Couchbase Web Console. The
    cluster needs to finish writing all information to disk. This will ensure that
    when you restart your cluster, all of your data can be brought back into the
    caching layer from disk. You can do this by monitoring the Disk Write Queue for
    every bucket in your cluster. The disk write queue should reach zero; this means
    no data remains to be written to disk.

 1. Open Web Console at a node in your cluster.

 1. Click Data Buckets | *your\_bucket*. In the Summary section, check that `disk
    write queue` reads 0. If you have more than one data bucket for your cluster,
    repeat this step to check each bucket has a disk write queue of 0.


    ![](images/upgrade_disk_write_zero.png)

 1. Create a backup of your cluster data using `cbbackup`. See [cbbackup
    Tool](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbbackup).

 1. Shutdown Couchbase Server on each machine in your cluster. For instructions, see
    [Server Startup and Shutdown](#couchbase-admin-basics-running)

 1. After you shutdown your nodes, perform a standard node upgrade to the new
    version of Couchbase Server. See [Upgrading Individual
    Nodes](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-individual) for instructions.

    Couchbase Server starts automatically on each node after you perform the node
    upgrade.

 1. As the cluster warms up, you can monitor the status of the warmup process to
    determine when you can switch on your application. See [Monitoring startup
    (warmup)](#couchbase-monitoring-startup).

Once the cluster finishes warmup, you can re-enable your application on the
upgraded cluster.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-individual"></a>

## Upgrading Individual Nodes

Whether you are performing an online or offline upgrade, the steps for upgrading
an individual nodes in a cluster remain the same:

 1. Download Couchbase Server

 1. Backup data for that node. To backup an existing Couchbase Server installation,
    use `cbbackup`. See [Backing Up Using
    cbbackup](#couchbase-backup-restore-backup-cbbackup).

 1. Backup the node-specific configuration files. While the upgrade script perform a
    backup of the configuration and data files, as a best practice you should make
    your own backup of these files:

    <a id="table-couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-individual"></a>

    Platform | Location
    ---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Linux    | `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat`
    Windows  | `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\Config\var\lib\couchbase\config\config.dat`

 1. Stop Couchbase Server. For instructions, see [Server Startup and
    Shutdown](#couchbase-admin-basics-running).

 1. Check your hostname configurations. If you have deployed Couchbase Server in a
    cloud service, or you are using hostnames rather than IP addresse, you must
    ensure that the hostname has been configured correctly before performing the
    upgrade. See [Using Hostnames with Couchbase
    Server](#couchbase-getting-started-hostnames)

 1. Check for required components and if needed, install them. This ensures that
    Couchbase Server upgrades and migrates your existing data files. See [Upgrades
    Notes 1.8.1 to 2.0 +](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-1-8-2-0).

 1. Perform the installation upgrade for your platform:

    **RHEL/Centos**

    You can perform an upgrade install using the RPM package — this will keep the
    data and existing configuration.

     ```
     root-shell> rpm -U couchbase-server-architecture___meta_current_version__.rpm
     ```

    **Ubuntu/Debian Linux**

    You can perform a package upgrade by installing the updated `.pkg` package:

     ```
     shell> sudo dpkg -i couchbase-server-architecture___meta_current_release.deb
     ```

    **Windows**

    The Install Wizard will upgrade your server installation using the same
    installation location. For example, if you have installed Couchbase Server in
    the default location, `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server`, the Couchbase Server
    installer will put the latest version at the same location.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-1-8-2-0"></a>

## Upgrades Notes 1.8.1 to 2.0 +

You can upgrade from Couchbase Server 1.8.1 to Couchbase Server 2.0 using either
the online or offline upgrade method. See [Upgrading to Couchbase Server
1.8](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-1.8/couchbase-getting-started-upgrade.html)
for more information.

**Use Online Upgrades for Couchbase Server 1.8.1 to Couchbase Server 2.0**

We recommend online upgrade method for 1.8.1 to 2.0. The process is quicker and
can take place while your cluster and application are up and running. When you
upgrade from Couchbase Server 1.8.1 to Couchbase Server 2.0, the data files are
updated to use the new Couchstore data format instead of the SQLite format used
in 1.8.1 and earlier. This increases the upgrade time, and requires additional
disk space to support the migration.

Be aware that if you perform a scripted online upgrade from 1.8.1 to 2.0 you
should have a 10 second delay from adding a 2.0 node to the cluster and
rebalancing. If you request rebalance too soon after adding a 2.0 node, the
rebalance may fail.

**Linux Upgrade Notes for 1.8.1 to 2.0**

When you upgrade from Couchbase Server 1.8.x to Couchbase Server 2.0 on Linux,
you should be aware of the **OpenSSL** requirement. OpenSSL is a required
component and you will get an error message during upgrade if it is not
installed. To install it RedHat-based systems, use `yum` :


```
root-shell> yum install openssl098e
```

On Debian-based systems, use `apt-get` to install the required OpenSSL package:


```
shell> sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8
```

**Windows Upgrade Notes for 1.8.1 to 2.0**

If you have configured your Couchbase Server nodes to use hostnames, rather than
IP addresses, to identify themselves within the cluster, you must ensure that
the IP and hostname configuration is correct both before the upgrade and after
upgrading the software. See [Hostnames for Couchbase Server 2.0.1 and
Earlier](#couchbase-getting-started-hostnames-pre2.0).

**Mac OSX Notes for 1.8.1 to 2.0**

There is currently no officially supported upgrade installer for Mac OSX. If you
want to migrate to 1.8.1 to 2.0 on OSX, you must make a backup of your data
files with `cbbackup`, install the latest version, then restore your data with
`cbrestore`. For more information, see [cbbackup
Tool](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbbackup) and [cbrestore
Tool](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbrestore).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-1-8-2-0-process"></a>

### Upgrade Notes 1.8 and Earlier to 2.0 +

If you run Couchbase Server 1.8 or earlier, you must upgrade to Couchbase Server
1.8.1 first. If you want to upgrade from Membase Server 1.7.2 or earlier, or
Couchbase Server 1.8 you also must upgrade to Couchbase Server 1.8.1 first. You
do this so that your data files can convert into 2.0 compatible formats. This
conversion is only available from 1.8.1 to 2.0 + upgrades.

 * **Online Upgrade**

   During online upgrade, new Couchbase Server 2.0 features are disabled until the
   entire cluster has been migrated to Couchbase Server 2.0. This includes views
   and XDCR.

 * **Offline Upgrade**

   To perform an offline upgrade, you use the standard installation system such as
   `dpkg`, `rpm` or Windows Setup Installer to upgrade the software on each
   machine. Each installer will perform the following operations:

    * Shutdown Couchbase Server 1.8. Do not uninstall the server.

    * Run the installer. The installer will detect any prerequisite software or
      components. An error is raised if the pre-requisites are missing. If you install
      additional required components such as OpenSSL during the upgrade, you must
      manually restart Couchbase after you install the components.

      The installer will copy 1.8.1-compatible data and configuration files to a
      backup location.

      The `cbupgrade` program will automatically start. This will non-destructively
      convert data from the 1.8.1 database file format (SQLite) to 2.0 database file
      format (couchstore). The 1.8 database files are left "as-is", and new 2.0
      database files are created. There must be enough disk space to handle this
      conversion operation (e.g., 3x more disk space).

   The data migration process from the old file format to the new file format may
   take some time. You should wait for the process to finish before you start
   Couchbase Server 2.0.

   Once the upgrade process finishes, Couchbase Server 2.0 starts automatically.
   Repeat this process on all nodes within your cluster.

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-cetoee"></a>

### Upgrading from Community Edition to Enterprise Edition

**You should use the same version number when you perform the migration process
to prevent version differences which may result in a failed upgrade.** To
upgrade between Couchbase Server Community Edition and Couchbase Server
Enterprise Edition, you can use two methods:

 * Perform an online upgrade

   Here you remove one node from the cluster and rebalance. On the nodes you have
   taken out of the cluster, uninstall Couchbase Server Community Edition package,
   and install Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition. You can then add the new nodes
   back into the cluster and rebalance. Repeat this process until the entire
   cluster is using the Enterprise Edition.

   For more information on performing online upgrades, see [Online
   Upgrades](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-online).

 * Perform an offline upgrade

   Shutdown the entire cluster, and uninstall Couchbase Server Community Edition
   from each machine. Then install Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition. The data
   files will be retained, and the cluster can be restarted.

   For more information on performing offline upgrades, see [Offline Upgrade
   Process](#couchbase-getting-started-upgrade-offline).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-testing"></a>

## Testing Couchbase Server

Testing the connection to the Couchbase Server can be performed in a number of
different ways. Connecting to the node using the web client to connect to the
admin console should provide basic confirmation that your node is available.
Using the `couchbase-cli` command to query your Couchbase Server node will
confirm that the node is available.

The Couchbase Server web console uses the same port number as clients use when
communicated with the server. If you can connect to the Couchbase Server web
console, administration and database clients should be able to connect to the
core cluster port and perform operations. The Web Console will also warn if the
console loses connectivity to the node.

To verify your installation works for clients, you can use either the
`cbworkloadgen` command, or `telnet`. The `cbworkloadgen` command uses the
Python Client SDK to communicate with the cluster, checking both the cluster
administration port and data update ports. For more information, see [Testing
Couchbase Server using
cbworkloadgen](#couchbase-getting-started-testing-cbworkloadgen).

Using `telnet` only checks the Memcached compatibility ports and the memcached
text-only protocol. For more information, see [Testing Couchbase Server using
Telnet](#couchbase-getting-started-testing-telnet).

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-testing-cbworkloadgen"></a>

### Testing Couchbase Server using cbworkloadgen

The `cbworkloadgen` is a basic tool that can be used to check the availability
and connectivity of a Couchbase Server cluster. The tool executes a number of
different operations to provide basic testing functionality for your server.

`cbworkloadgen` provides basic testing functionality. It does not provide
performance or workload testing.

To test a Couchbase Server installation using `cbworkloadgen`, execute the
command supplying the IP address of the running node:


```
shell> cbworkloadgen -n localhost:8091
Thread 0 - average set time : 0.0257480939229 seconds , min : 0.00325512886047 seconds , max : 0.0705931186676 seconds , operation timeouts 0
```

The progress and activity of the tool can also be monitored within the web
console.

For a longer test you can increase the number of iterations:


```
shell> cbworkloadgen -n localhost:8091 --items=100000
```

<a id="couchbase-getting-started-testing-telnet"></a>

### Testing Couchbase Server using Telnet

You can test your Couchbase Server installation by using Telnet to connect to
the server and using the Memcached text protocol. This is the simplest method
for determining if your Couchbase Server is running.

You will not need to use the Telnet method for communicating with your server
within your application. Instead, use one of the Couchbase SDKs.

You will need to have `telnet` installed on your server to connect to Couchbase
Server using this method. Telnet is supplied as standard on most platforms, or
may be available as a separate package that should be easily installable via
your operating systems standard package manager.

Connect to the server:


```
shell> telnet localhost1
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
```

Make sure it's responding (stats is a great way to check basic health):


```
stats
STAT delete_misses 0
STAT ep_io_num_write 0
STAT rejected_conns 0
...
STAT time 1286678223
...
STAT curr_items_tot 0
...
STAT threads 4
STAT pid 23871
...

## Next Steps

 * For basic instructions on using your Couchbase Server installation, see
   [Administration Basics](#couchbase-admin-basics).

 * For information on deploying and building your Couchbase Server cluster, see
   [Deployment Strategies](#couchbase-deployment).

 * For instructions on how to use the Couchbase Web Console to manage your
   Couchbase Server installation, see [Using the Web
   Console](#couchbase-admin-web-console).

 * If you already have an application that uses the Memcached protocol then you can
   start using your Couchbase Server immediately. If so, you can simply point your
   application to this server like you would any other memcached server. No code
   changes or special libraries are needed, and the application will behave exactly
   as it would against a standard memcached server. Without the client knowing
   anything about it, the data is being replicated, persisted, and the cluster can
   be expanded or contracted completely transparently.

   If you do not already have an application, then you should investigate one of
   the available Couchbase client libraries to connect to your server and start
   storing and retrieving information. For more information, see [Couchbase
   SDKs](http://www.couchbase.com/develop).
