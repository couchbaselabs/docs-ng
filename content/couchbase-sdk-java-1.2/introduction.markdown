# Introduction

Welcome to the official Java SDK documentation. The first chapter gets you started on the basic functionality, laying the foundation for the later chapters. If you want to see how to build a full-blown application on top of Couchbase, look for the tutorial section next.

The "Using the APIs" setion holds self-contained reference material about API usage. Go there if you want to dig into topics like storing data, using views and so on. Finally, "Advanced Usage" contains helpful chapters about topics that come up during debugging and production or relate to in-depth information.
