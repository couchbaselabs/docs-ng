# Creating Your First Application

This chapters assumes you have arrived at this page as a starting place for
developing on Couchbase Server with a Couchbase SDK. It covers the following
topics:

 * Resources for setting up your development environment,

 * Creating a first data bucket for development,

 * Connecting to Couchbase Server from Couchbase SDKs,

 * Performing a basic query from Couchbase SDKs,

 * Introduction to telnet operations to view database entries.

Another useful place to start if you are just beginning to develop with a
Couchbase SDK is the Getting Started Guides and tutorials which are provided in
each SDK language. For more information, see [Develop with
Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/develop).

<a id="couchbase-dev-prerequisites"></a>

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Beyond a standard web application development environment, including a
development machine/OS and a web application server, you will need the following
components for your development environment:

 * Couchbase Server: installed on a virtual or physical machine separate from the
   machine containing your web application server. Download the appropriate version
   for your environment here: [Couchbase Server
   Downloads](http://www.couchbase.com/download)

 * Couchbase SDK: installed for runtime on the machine containing your web
   application server. You will also need to make the SDK's available in your
   development environment in order to compile/interpret your client-side code. The
   SDKs are programming-language and platform-specific. You will use your SDK to
   communicate with the Couchbase Server from your web application. Downloads for
   your chosen SDK are here: [Couchbase SDK
   Downloads](http://www.couchbase.com/develop)

 * Couchbase Admin Console: administering your Couchbase Server is done via the
   Couchbase Admin Console, a web application viewable in most modern browsers.
   Your development environment should therefore have the latest version of Mozilla
   Firefox 3.6+, Apple Safari 5+, Google Chrome 11, or Internet Explorer 8, or
   higher. You should set your browser preference to be JavaScript enabled.

The following are supported platforms for the majority of Couchbase Client
SDK's:

 * CentOS 5.5 (Red Hat and Fedora compatible), 32- and 64- bit

 * Ubuntu 10.04 (Red Hat and Fedora compatible), 32- and 64- bit

 * Microsoft Windows, for the case of.NET, Java and Ruby SDKs

The following virtual machines are supported:

 * Java VM

 * Microsoft.NET VM

The following are development languages supported by the Couchbase Client SDK
Libraries:

 * Java

 * .NET

 * PHP

 * Ruby

 * C

The TCP/IP port allocation on Windows by default includes a restricted number of
ports available for client communication. For more information on this issue,
including information on how to adjust the configuration and increase the
available ports, see <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx> MSDN: Avoiding TCP/IP Port Exhaustion</a>.

Depending upon the OS for your development platform and web application server
platform, choose the 32- or 64- bit versions of the SDK. Download and install
the following three packages which contain the SDK's:

 * 64- or 32- bit, OS-specific package.

 * 64- or 32- Library Headers.

 * 64- or 32- Debug Symbols.

The.NET and Java SDKs provide their own packages which contain all the libraries
required. Please refer to the individual SDK documentation for these two
languages for more information on installation.

Beyond installation of these three core packages for any given language or
framework, language/framework specific installation information and system
prerequisites can be found in each respective SDK guide, e.g. Java SDK Guides.
Notably, the scripting languages SDKs, such as those for Ruby and PHP, will also
require installation of Couchbase SDKs for C.

<a id="couchbase-connecting-to-cbserver"></a>

## Connecting to Couchbase Server

After you have your Couchbase Server up and running, and your chosen Couchbase
Client libraries installed on a web server, you create the code that connects to
the server from the client.

<a id="creating-a-bucket"></a>

### Create Your First Bucket

The first thing you will want to do after you set up Couchbase Server and you
want to explore the SDKs is to create a data bucket. You can do so with the
Couchbase Admin Console, or you can use the REST API. For your first application
in this chapter, we will show the REST API approach, which you may be less
familiar with after your initial server install. For more information about
creating named buckets via the Couchbase Admin Console, see [Couchbase Server
Manual 2.1.0, Creating and Editing Data
Buckets](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.1.0/couchbase-admin-web-console-data-buckets-createedit.html)

You create either a Couchbase or memcached bucket using the REST API. When you
make a request, you provide a REST request using a REST client or a UNIX utility
such as curl.

 1. Make a new bucket request to the REST endpoint for buckets and provide the new
    bucket settings as request parameters:

     ```
     shell> curl -u Administrator:password \
                         -d name=newBucket -d ramQuotaMB=100 -d authType=none \
                         -d replicaNumber=1 -d proxyPort=11215 http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets
     ```

    To create a bucket we first provide our credentials for the bucket. These are
    the same credentials we established when we first installed Couchbase Server.
    For the sake of convenience, we create a single Couchbase bucket named
    `newBucket` with a RAM quota of 100MB. We require no authentication for the
    bucket and set the proxy port for the bucket to 11215.

    Couchbase Server sends back this HTTP response:

     ```
     202
     ```

 1. You can check your new bucket exists and is running by making a request REST
    request to the new bucket:

     ```
     curl http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/newBucket
     ```

    Couchbase Server will respond with a JSON document containing information on the
    new bucket:

     ```
     {"name":"newcachebucket","bucketType":"couchbase",

     ....

     "bucketCapabilities":["touch","couchapi"]}
     ```

    For this request we go to the same REST URI used when we created the bucket,
    plus we add the endpoint information for the new bucket, `/newBucket`. For this
    type of request we do not need to provide any credentials. The response document
    contains other REST requests you can make for the bucket as well as bucket
    settings/properties.

After you create your first data bucket, you can begin interacting with that
bucket using a Couchbase SDK. To learn more about the Couchbase REST API,
particularly for administrative functions, see [Couchbase Server Manual, REST
API for
Administration](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.1.0/couchbase-admin-restapi.html)

<a id="couchbase-client-connecting"></a>

### Connecting with Couchbase SDKs

To create a connection to Couchbase Server you create a Couchbase client
instance which contains and manages connection information to the server. By
default Couchbase Server uses the URI `http://localhost:8091/pools` for
connections with Couchbase SDKs. This is the URI you can use to establish an
initial connection to the cluster. A Couchbase SDK will also automatically
adjust the port uses to communicate to the Couchbase Server based on any changes
to cluster topology. Therefore it is not necessary to adjust your code for
connecting to accommodate cluster rebalance, or to accommodate node addition or
deletion.

In order to connect and perform data operations, you will need to have at least
one default data bucket established, for instance one that you have made in the
Couchbase Administrative Console or the REST API.

The following shows a basic steps for creating a connection:

 1. Include, import, link, or require Couchbase SDK libraries into your program
    files. In the example that follows, we `require 'couchbase'`.

 1. Provide connection information for the Couchbase cluster. Typically this
    includes URI, bucket ID, a password and optional parameters and can be provided
    as a list or string. To avoid failure to initially connect, you should provide
    and try at least two URL's for two different nodes. In the following example, we
    provide connection information as `"http://<host>:<port>/pools"`. In this case
    there is no password required.

 1. Create an instance of a Couchbase client object. In the example that follows, we
    create a new client instance in the `client = Couchbase.connect` statement.

 1. Perform any database operations for your applications, such as read, write,
    delete, or query.

 1. If needed, destroy the client, and therefore disconnect.

The following demonstrates this process using the Ruby SDK to connect to a
default data bucket:


```
require 'couchbase'

client = Couchbase.connect "http://<host>:8091/pools"

begin
  client.set "hello", "Hello World!", :ttl => 10
  spoon = client.get "hello"
  puts spoon
rescue Couchbase::Error::NotFound => e
  puts "There is no record."
end
```

In this example, we set and retrieve data in a Ruby `begin rescue end` block.
The code block attempts to set the value "Hello World!" for the key "spoon" with
an expiration of 10 seconds. Then gets the value for the "spoon" key and outputs
it. If the Couchbase client receives and error, it outputs "There is no spoon."

(Optional) Depending on the language you are using, you may need to be
responsible for explicitly destroying the Couchbase client object, and thereby
destroying the connection. Typically it is a best practice to try to reuse the
same client instance across multiple processes and threads, rather than
constantly create and destroy clients. This will provide better application
performance and reduce processing times. For more information about client
instance reuse and connection pooling, see [Optimizing Client
Instances](optimizing-client-instances) and [Maintaining Persistent
Connections](cb-persistent-connections).

The next example in Java we demonstrate how it is safest to create at least two
possible node URIs while creating an initial connection with the server. This
way, if your application attempts to connect, but one node is down, the client
automatically reattempt connection with the second node URL:


```
// Set up at least two URIs in case one server fails

List<URI> servers = new ArrayList<URI>();
servers.add("http://<host>:8091/pools");
servers.add("http://<host>:8091/pools");

// Create a client talking to the default bucket

CouchbaseClient cbc = new CouchbaseClient(servers, "default", "");

// Create a client talking to the default bucket

CouchbaseClient cbc = new CouchbaseClient(servers, "default", "");

System.err.println(cbc.get(“thisname") +
  " is off developing with Couchbase!");
```

A similar approach should be followed in any language when you attempt to
connect to a Couchbase cluster. That is, you should set up an array of two or
more possible nodes and then attempt to connect to at least one node in an array
before performing other operations. The following demonstrates creating a
connection with more than one possible URI in Ruby:


```
Couchbase.connect(:node_list => ['<host>:8091', '<host>:8091',
   'example.net'])
```

After your initial connection with Couchbase Server, you will not need to
reattempt server connection using an explicit list of node URLs after rebalance
or node failure. After this initial connection, your Couchbase client will
receive cluster information with all nodes available for connection. After
rebalance and failover, if a client instance still exists, it will get updated
cluster information with updated node URLs.

<a id="cb-authenticating"></a>

### Authenticating a Client

When you create a connection to the Couchbase Server, you are actually creating
a new instance of a Couchbase client object which contains your connection
information. Typically when you establish a bucket for your application, either
in Couchbase Admin Console, or via a REST API call, you provide required
credentials. When you connect to the bucket, provide your username and password
as parameters in your SDK call to `Couchbase.connect()` :


```
Couchbase.connect("http://<host>:8091/pools",
                                          :bucket => 'bucket1',
                                          :username => 'Administrator',
                                          :password => 'password')
```

This next example demonstrates use of credentials in PHP:


```
<?php
        $cb = new Couchbase(”<host>:8091", "bucketname", "password", "user");
        ?>
```

<a id="cb-basic-connect-get-set"></a>

## Performing Connect, Set and Get

After you create a connection to Couchbase Server with a client instance, you
can perform reads/writes of data with that client instance. Documents reads and
writes require a key as parameter; in the case of a document write, you also
provide the document value as JSON or binary. The following example demonstrates
connecting, setting, then getting a record in PHP:


```
<?php

$cb = new Couchbase(”host:8091", "user", "password");

$cb->set("hello", "Hello World");

var_dump($cb->get("hello"));

?>
```

In this case, we create a Couchbase client instance and connect to the default
bucket with the username and password of `user` and `password`. The same pattern
would be used in any given SDK: connect, then perform a set with key/value, and
within the same connection, get and output the new value. Here is another
example we will build upon later when we do a basic first query. In this case we
connect then store the name and age of students. This is using the Ruby SDK.


```
require 'couchbase'

client = Couchbase.connect("http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/newBucket")

names = [{'id' => 'doc1', 'name' => 'Aaron', 'age' => 20},
{'id' => 'doc2', 'name' => 'John', 'age' => 24},
{'id' => 'doc3', 'name' => 'Peter', 'age' => 16},
{'id' => 'doc4', 'name' => 'Ralf', 'age' => 12}
]

names.each do |name|
client.set(name['id'], name )
end

begin
  name = client.get "doc1"
  puts name
rescue Couchbase::Error::NotFound => e
  puts "There is no record"
end
```

To begin this example, we import any libraries we require for our application.
Then we create a connection to the Couchbase bucket `newBucket` that we created
earlier in [Create Your First Bucket](#creating-a-bucket).

After we create a Couchbase client instance, we create a Ruby array containing
individual hashes. Each hash contains information for a user. We look through
each element in the array and store an entry with the `id` field as key and the
hash contents as JSON documents.

In a `begin rescue end` block we try to retrieve the first record from Couchbase
Server and output it. If the Couchbase client receives an error, it outputs
"There is no record."

<a id="cb-first-query"></a>

## Performing a First Query

As of Couchbase 2.0, you can index and query entries using views. Views are
functions you define and use to filter, extract and perform calculations on
entries that are persisted in a given data bucket. The functions you create will
provide a 'map' function, which can filter/extract items based on rules you
specify, and may optionally perform a 'reduce' function, which can perform
calculations and operations across a selected group of entries. There are a few
possible ways you can initially store and use views functions as JSON documents:

 * Create and manage using Couchbase Admin Console, or

 * Create and manage using the REST API, or

 * Create, store, and query using your chosen Couchbase SDK.

Since this content is for the developer audience, we will focus here on using
the SDKs to perform queries and describe the REST API as an alternative
approach.

Imagine in our previous example that we also want to find all the names of users
who are under 21. In this scenario we would use a view; in fact we would want to
use views in any other scenario where we want to filter entries based on certain
field values, or provide lists and tables of certain entries. For this example
we provide the map function for you. If you are more familiar with views in
Couchbase 2.0, you may notice some missing elements in our map function. For the
sake of brevity here and for newcomers to views, we omitted some of the
complexity for now:


```
function (doc) {
    if ( doc.age && doc.name ) {
    if ( doc.age < 21 ) { emit(doc.name, doc.age) };
  }
}
```

You may not have used JavaScript before, but if you have used other programming
languages such as C, Java, or PHP, this should look familiar to you. This is a
standard function definition with one parameter, `doc` which is a JSON document
stored in Couchbase Server.

The key part of this function to understand is the conditional statement `if
(doc.age < 21 )....`. This is how you specify the core logic of your map
function. In this case, we are saying that if `age` field has a value less than
21, we want information from that record extracted and put in the result set.
The next part of the code, `emit(doc.name, doc.age)` indicates when Couchbase
Server finds a matching record, it should include value from the `name` field
and should include value from the `age` field in the result set.

As a best practice we want make sure that the fields we want to include in our
index actually exist. Therefore we have our map function within a conditional:
`if (doc.age && doc.name)`. This ensures the fields exist in documents when we
query the view and we therefore avoid a view failure when Couchbase Server
generates the index.

For the sake of convenience, we can store our view in a 'design document' and
then use a Couchbase SDK to store it from the file. Design documents are JSON
documents where we store our views functions as strings; they are stored in
Couchbase Server and are associated with a Couchbase Bucket. First we create the
design document and include our view function in it:


```
{
  "_id": "_design/students",
  "language": "javascript",
  "views": {
    "underage": {
      "map": "function(doc) {if (doc.age && doc.name)
{if(doc.age < 21){emit(doc.name, doc.age);}}}"
    }
  }
}
```

The first two fields indicate the JSON document is a design document named
`students` and it follows the syntax used in JavaScript. The next field is a
hash that contains any views and in this case we have one view called
`underage`. Within the view we provide the map function described above. We can
store this to the file system as `students.json` and then write the design
document to Couchbase Server using an SDK.

As a best practice we want make sure that the fields we want to include in our
index actually exist. Therefore we have our map function within a conditional:
`if (doc.age && doc.name)`. This ensures the fields exist in documents when we
query the view and we therefore avoid a view failure when Couchbase Server
generates the index.


```
client = Couchbase.connect("http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/newBucket")

client.save_design_doc(File.open('students.json'))
```

We open the `students.json` file and then write it to Couchbase Server with the
`save_design_doc` call. Couchbase Server will store a new design document with
the key `students` which is available from our SDK. At this point we can query
the view and retrieve matching results:


```
students = client.design_docs['students']

students.views                    #=> ["underage"]

students.underage
```

The first things we do is retrieve the design document from Couchbase Server. We
do this by first calling `design_docs` with the named design document
`students`, and then call `views` to get the views it contains. Finally we
perform the query by calling the view, in this case we call `underage`.
Couchbase Server will execute the map function in our view and return this
information in the result set:


```
.... @id="doc1" @key="Aaron" @value=20 ....
.... @id="doc3" @key="Peter" @value=16 ....
.... @id="doc4" @key="Ralf" @value=12 ....
```

If you go back and look at our map function, we indicate we want to extract
`doc.name` and `doc.age`. Couchbase Server provides the key for the document
containing a matching field value under 21, which is `docNum`, as well as the
name and age of the student. As an alternate approach, you can also store a view
in Couchbase Server by using the REST API and then query it using a REST
request. To store the view, you would make a REST request as follows:


```
curl -X PUT -u newBucket:password -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 'http://server_ip:8092/newBucket/_design/students' \
-d '{"views": {"underage":{"map":"function(doc) {if(doc.age && doc.name) \
{if(doc.age<21){emit(doc.name, doc.age);}}}"}}}'
```

We perform the REST request as a put and provide the bucket name and password
for that bucket. We indicate the content will be JSON, and the rest endpoint is
the Couchbase bucket along with `/_design/students`. Finally we provide the view
as the request payload. After Couchbase Server successfully stores the new
design document `students` with the `underage` view, it provides a response in
JSON:


```
{"ok":true, "id":"_design/students"}
```

Now we can query the view by performing a REST request as follows:


```
curl -X GET -u newBucket:password 'http://server_ip:8092/newBucket/_design/students/_view/underage?'
```

Couchbase Server responds with the following results as JSON:


```
{"total_rows":3,"rows":[
{"id":"doc1", "key":"Aaron", "age":20},
{"id":"doc3", "key":"Peter", "age":16},
{"id":"doc4", "key":"Ralf", "age":12}
]
}
```

This section is intended as a brief introduction to querying and indexing JSON
documents with Couchbase SDKs. There is definitely much more to learn about the
topic. For more detailed information about the topic, see [Finding Data with
Views](#indexing-querying-data) for using views with the SDKs, and [Couchbase
Server Manual, Views and
Indexes](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.1.0/couchbase-views.html)
for understanding indexing and querying in general with Couchbase Server 2.1.0.

<a id="cb-basic-telnet-ops"></a>

## Performing Basic Telnet Operations

When you first begin developing with Couchbase SDKs it is useful to know you can
also create a telnet connection to the Couchbase Server. Once you create the
connection, you can also experiment with simple gets and sets, to check to see
if your SDK-level operations are actually working. When you telnet to Couchbase
Server, you can perform retrieves and writes for a specific key.

To connect Couchbase Server via telnet, provide the host and port where it is
located. The default bucket created on the Couchbase Server will be on port
11211 for purposes of telnet. This does not require any authentication:


```
telnet localhost 11211
```

Note that when we telnet to port 11211 this is connecting to the default bucket
at Couchbase Server. There are some cases that you may need to telnet to another
port for instance if you are using moxi, or if you want to connect to a
different bucket. After you successfully connect, you can enter commands at the
telnet prompt. In the example that follows we set a key/value pair via the
telnet session.


```
set name1 0 0 5
     karen
```

In this example we provide they key as 'name1', the flags as 0, TTL as 0, and
the length of value to be set as 5 characters, respectively. After we return the
set command via telnet, we can enter the actual value which is 'karen' in this
cadd ase. After Couchbase Server successfully stores the key/value, it will
return STORED via telnet. The next examples demonstrate use of get and delete
via telnet:


```
get name2
     VALUE name2 0 3
     ari
     END
```

Couchbase Server will return the value followed by an END statement. Notice that
TTL is not returned in this case. When you delete a value, Couchbase Server will
respond via telnet with DELETED if it successfully removes the item, and if is
unsuccessful it will return NOT\_FOUND:


```
delete name3
    DELETED
    delete name3
    NOT_FOUND
```

For this next example we demonstrate adding a record via telnet. This shows the
general distinction between adding and setting a record. If a given key already
exists, setting a record will overwrite it; if you try to add the record,
Couchbase Server will return an error and preserve the existing record:


```
add name1 0 0 4
      erin
      STORED
      add name1 0 0 2
      ed
      NOT_STORED
```

In this case we first add a new key/value of name1/erin via telnet and received
the message STORED from Couchbase Server. When we attempt to add the same key
with a new value, Couchbase Server returns NOT\_STORED via telnet. This helps
provide some form of consistency and atomicity for the record when you use `add`
and it fails for an existing key. In order to change the value of an existing
key, we need to use the `replace` method.

To update a value via telnet, you use the `replace` command with the original
key:


```
set sue 0 0 2
    ok
    STORED
    replace sue 0 0 3
    new
    STORED
    get sue
    VALUE sue 0 3
    new
    END
```

In the first three lines of the session, we set the new key 'sue' with 0 as
flags, 0 as TTL, a value 'ok' of length 2. Couchbase sets the new record
successfully and returns STORED. Then we replace the key sue with a new value of
length 3, 'new'. After the new value is successfully stored, we get it and the
record Couchbase retrieves reflects this change. Notice when you replace a key,
you can also update the flags and TTL should you choose to do so.

This next example demonstrates a check and set command at the telnet prompt. For
check and set use the `cas` command and provide any new flags, expiration, new
length, and cas value. We can retrieve the cas value for a key using the `gets`
command:


```
set record1 0 0 4
      sara
      STORED
      gets record1
      VALUE record1 0 4 10
      sara
      END
      cas record1 0 0 7 10
      maybell
      STORED
```

In this example we set record1 to have 0 flags, 0 expiration, and a length of 4
characters. We set the value to the name 'sara'. When Couchbase Server
successfully stores the record it automatically creates a cas value. which we
get with gets. The last number returned by gets in the telnet session is the cas
value. In this next step, we perform a check and set with the record1 key with
no flags, no expiration, seven characters and the value 'maybell.'


```
cas record1 0 0 7 10
      maybell
      STORED
```

When the cas command succeeds, Couchbase server updates the cas value for
record1. If you attempt to check and set the record with the wrong cas value,
Couchbase Server will return the error 'EXISTS' to the telnet session:


```
cas record1 0 0 3 10
      sue
      EXISTS
```
