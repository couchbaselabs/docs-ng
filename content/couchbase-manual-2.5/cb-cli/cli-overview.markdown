# Command-line interface overview

Couchbase Server includes a number of command-line tools that can be used to
manage and monitor a Couchbase Server cluster or server. All operations are
mapped to their appropriate [REST API](../cb-rest-api/#couchbase-admin-restapi) call
(where available).

There are a number of command-line tools that perform different functions and
operations, these are described individually within the following sections.
Tools can be located in a number of directories, dependent on the tool in
question in each case.

## Command line tools and availability

As of Couchbase Server 2.0, the following publicly available tools have been
renamed, consolidated or removed. This is to provide better usability, and
reduce the number of commands required to manage Couchbase Server:

By default, the command-line tools are installed into the following locations on
each platform:
