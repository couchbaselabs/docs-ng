# Getting Started

This chapter will teach you the basics of Couchbase and how to interact with it
through the Ruby Client SDK.

If you haven’t already, download the latest Couchbase Server 2.0 release and
install it. While following the download instructions and setup wizard, make
sure install the `beer-sample` default bucket. It contains sample data of beers
and breweries, which we’ll be using in our examples here. If you’ve already
installed Couchbase Server 2.0 and didn’t install the `beer-sample` bucket (or
if you deleted it), just open the Web-UI and navigate to "Settings/Sample
Buckets". Activate the `beer-sample` checkbox and click "Create". In the right
hand corner you’ll see a notification box that will disappear once the bucket is
ready to be used.

Here’s a quick outline of what you’ll learn in this chapter:

 1. Install the library with its dependencies.

 1. Write a simple program to demonstrate connecting to Couchbase and saving some
    documents.

From here on, we’ll assume that you have a Couchbase Server 2.0 release running
and the `beer-sample` bucket configured. If you need any help on setting up
everything, there is plenty of documentation available:

 * Using the [Couchbase Web
   Console](http://couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-introduction.html),
   for information on using the Couchbase Administrative Console,

 * [Couchbase
   CLI](http://couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-admin-web-console.html),
   for the command line interface,

 * [Couchbase REST
   API](http://couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-admin-restapi.html),
   for creating and managing Couchbase resources.

## Installing the Couchbase Client Libraries

Before you start you should have a working Ruby environment up and running. We
recommend Ruby 1.9.2 or 1.8.7 [http://ruby-lang.org](http://ruby-lang.org).

You can verify that Ruby is installed by typing the following command:

```
shell> ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3p286 (2012-10-12 revision 37165) [x86_64-linux]
```

Another dependency needed for the client is libcouchbase. Please consult  [C Client Library](http://www.couchbase.com/develop/c/current) page about ways to get it on your system. Here we will assume you are using the Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux family and have the `apt` tool.

Note that the libcouchbase dependency is not needed if you are on Microsoft Windows, as all dependencies are bundled in the source.

Once you have installed libcouchbase, you are then ready to install the most recent client using rubygems.

```
shell> gem install couchbase
Fetching: couchbase-1.2.0.gem (100%)
Building native extensions.  This could take a while... Successfully installed
couchbase-1.2.0 1 gem installed
```

Lets load and verify the library version.

```
shell> ruby -rrubygems -rcouchbase -e 'puts Couchbase::VERSION' 1.2.0
```

The TCP/IP port allocation on Windows by default includes a restricted number of ports available for client communication. For more information on this issue, including information on how to adjust the configuration and increase the available ports, see <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx>MSDN: Avoiding TCP/IP Port Exhaustion</a>.

## Hello Couchbase

To follow the tradition of programming tutorials, we’ll start with "Hello
Couchbase". In the first example, we’ll connect to the Cluster, retrieve a
document, print it out and modify it. This first example contains the full
source code, but in later example we’ll omit the preamble and assume we’re
already connected to the cluster.


```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'couchbase'

client = Couchbase.connect(:bucket => "beer-sample",
:host => "localhost")

beer = client.get("aass_brewery-juleol")
puts "#{beer['name']}, ABV: #{beer['abv']}"

beer['comment'] = "Random beer from Norway"
client.replace("aass_brewery-juleol", beer)

client.disconnect
```

While this code should be very easy to grasp, there is a lot going on worth a
little more discussion:

 * Connecting: the `Couchbase.connect` basically creates an instance of
   `Couchbase::Bucket` class internally passing all arguments to its contructor.
   You can see complete list of options on the [API documentation
   site](http://rdoc.info/gems/couchbase/Couchbase/Bucket#initialize-instance_method).
   In our example the most interesting option is `:bucket`. Because our data bucket
   isn’t "default" we must specify it during connection. The bucket is the
   container for all your documents. Inside a bucket, a key — the identifier for a
   document — must be unique.

   In production environments, it is recommended to use a password on a bucket
   (this can be configured during bucket creation), but when you are just starting
   out using the default bucket without a password is fine. Note that the
   `beer-sample` bucket also doesn’t have a password, so just change the bucket
   name and you’re set. Another option is `:host` which tells the client library
   the address of the cluster. While passing in only one host is fine, it is
   strongly recommended to add two or three (of course, if your cluster has more
   than one node) and use `:node_list` option instead. It is important to
   understand that this list does not have to contain all nodes in the
   cluster — you just need to provide a few so that during the initial bootstrap
   phase the Client is able to connect to the server. Any two or three nodes will
   be fine, but maintain this list. After this has happened, the Client
   automatically fetches the cluster configuration and keeps it up to date, even
   when the cluster topology changes. This means that you don’t need to change your
   application config at all when you resize your cluster.

 * Set and get: these two operations are the most fundamental ones. You can use set
   to create or completely replace a document inside your bucket and get to read it
   back afterwards. There are lots of arguments and variations, but if you just use
   them as shown in the previous example will get you pretty far. The sample is
   using the `Couchbase::Bucket#replace` operation. It behaves exactly like `#set`
   but will raise an error if the document isn’t in the bucket. Note that by
   default all operations are using JSON to store your documents, so make sure it
   is possible to represent your values in this format. If not, you might use
   `:marshal` format. Find more info about the formats in the API documentation.

 * Disconnecting: at the end of the program (or when you shutdown your server
   instance), you should use the `Couchbase::Bucket#disconnect` method. But you
   should know that the instance will be disconnected properly if it is destroyed
   by garbage collector.

That’s it. We’re ready to run our first Couchbase program.

## Working with Documents

A document in Couchbase Server consists of a value and meta information, like a
unique key, a CAS value, flags etc. These are all stored in a bucket. A document
can be anything, but it is recommended to use the JSON format. JSON is very
convenient for storing structured data with little overhead, and is also used
inside the View engine. This means that if you want to get most out of Couchbase
Server 2.0, use JSON.

The couchbase client will use any of accessible JSON libraries supported by
[multi\_json gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/multi_json). This mean if your
values are serializable with `MultiJson.dump`, you can pass them to mutator
methods and be sure you will get them later in the same form.

The following chapter introduces the basic operations that you can use as the
fundamental building blocks of your application.

Here’s a quick outline of what you’ll learn in this chapter:

 1. Write a program to demonstrate using Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)
    operations on documents.

 1. Explore some of the API methods that will take you further than what you’ve seen
    previously.

<a id="creating_and_updating_documents"></a>

### Creating and Updating Documents

Couchbase Server provides a set of commands to store documents. The commands are
very similar to each other and differ only in their meaning on the server-side.
These are:

|Command | Description|
| ------	| ------	|
|`set` | Stores a document in Couchbase Server (identified by its unique key) and overrides the previous document (if there was one).|
|`add` | Adds a document in Couchbase Server (identified by its unique key) and fails if there is already a document with the same key stored.|
|`replace` | Replaces a document in Couchbase Server (identified by its unique key) and fails if there is no document with the given key already in place.|

There are also additional commands mutation commands, which do make sense when
you are working in `:plain` mode, because they are implemented on the server and
not JSON-aware. But still they might be useful in your application:

|Command | Description|
| ------	| ------	|
|`prepend`   | Prepend given string to the value. The concatenation is done on the server side.
|`append`    | Append given string to the value. The concatenation is also done on the server side.
|`increment` | Increment, atomically, the value. The value is a string representation of an unsigned integer. The new value is returned by the operation. By default it will increment by one. See API reference for other options.
|`decrement` | Decrement, atomically, the value. The value is a string representation of an unsigned integer. The new value is returned by the operation. By default it will decrement by one. See API reference for other options.

The SDK provides several options for these operations, but to start out here are
the simplest forms:


```ruby
key = "aass_brewery-juleol"
doc = {"name" => "Juleøl", "abv" => 5.9}

client.add(key, doc);
client.set(key, doc);
client.replace(key, doc);
```

### Reading Documents

With Couchbase Server 2.0, you have two ways of fetching your documents: either
by the unique key through the get method, or through Views. Since Views are more
complex, let’s just look at a simple get first:


```ruby
doc = client.get("aass_brewery-juleol")

keys = ["foo", "bar"]
docs = client.get(keys, :quiet => true)
```

In this case you will receve the Hash document you stored earlier. If there no
such key in the bucket, the exception `Couchbase::Error:NotFound` will be
raised. But you can suppress all `NotFound` errors by using option `:quiet =>
true` and the method will return `nil` instead. The `Couchbase::Bucket#get`
method can also accept list of keys returning list of documents.

With Couchbase Server 2.0, the very powerful ability to query your documents
across this distributed system through secondary indexes (Views) has been added
to your toolbelt. This guide gets you started on how to use them through the
Ruby SDK, if you want to learn more please refer to [the chapter in the
Couchbase Server 2.0
documentation](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-views.html).

Once you created your View in the UI, you can query it from the SDK in two
steps. First, you grab the design document definition from the cluster, second
query view with options you need and use results. In its simplest form, it looks
like this:


```ruby
# Step 1: Get the design document definition
ddoc = client.design_docs["beer"]
ddoc.views      #=> ["brewery_beers", "by_location"]

# Step 2: Query the view and use results
ddoc.brewery_beers.each do |row|
puts row.key
puts row.value
puts row.id
puts row.doc
end
```

Note that the view request won’t be executed until you will try to access the
results. This means that you can pass view object ( `ddoc.brewery_beers` here)
without executing it.

Views can be queried with a large amount of options to change what the results
of the query will contain. All supported options are available as items in
options Hash accepted either by the view method or by `#each` iterator on the
view. Here are some of them:

|Option|Description|
| ------	| ------	|
|include\_docs (Boolean) | Used to define if the complete documents should be fetched with the result ( `false` by default). Note this will actually fetch the document itself from the cache, so if it has been changed or deleted you may not receive a document that matches the view, or any at all.
|reduce (Boolean)        | Used to enable/disable the reduce function (if there is one defined on the server). `true` by default.
|limit (Fixnum)          | Limit the number of results that should be returned.
|descending (Boolean)    | Revert the sorting order of the result set. ( `false` by default)
|stale (Boolean, Symbol) | Can be used to define the tradeoff between performance and freshness of the data. ( `:update_after` by default)

Now that we have our View information in place, we can issue the query, which
actually triggers the scatter-gather data loading process on the Cluster. We can
use it to iterate over the results and print out some details (here is a more
complete example which also includes the full documents and only fetches the
first five results). The resulting information is encapsulated inside the
`ViewRow` object.


```ruby
view = client.design_docs["beer"].brewery_beers

# Include all docs and limit to 5
view.each(:include_docs => true, :limit => 5) do |row|
puts row.id
# The full document (as a Hash) is available through row.doc
end
```

In the logs, you can see the corresponding document keys automatically sorted (ascending):

```
21st_amendment_brewery_cafe 21st_amendment_brewery_cafe-21a_ipa
21st_amendment_brewery_cafe-563_stout
21st_amendment_brewery_cafe-amendment_pale_ale
21st_amendment_brewery_cafe-bitter_american`
```

### Deleting Documents

If you want to get rid of a document, you can use the delete operation:


```
client.delete("aass_brewery-juleol");
```

## Advanced Topics

This chapter introduces some techniques topics that you can use to further
extend your Couchbase vocabulary.

<a id="cas_and_locking"></a>

### CAS and Locking

If you need to coordinate shared access on documents, Couchbase helps you with
two approaches. Depending on the application you may need to use both of them,
but in general it is better (if feasible) to lean towards CAS because it
provides the better performance characteristics.

### Optimistic Locking

Each document has a unique identifier associated with it (the CAS value), which
changes when the document itself is mutated. You can fetch the CAS value for a
given key and pass it to any mutator operation to protect it. The update will
only succeed, when the CAS value is still the same. This is why it’s called
optimistic locking. Someone else can still read and try to update the document,
but it will fail once the CAS value has changed. Here is a example on how to do
it with the Ruby SDK:


```ruby
key = "eagle_brewing-golden"
# Reads the document with the CAS value.
beer, flags, cas = client.get(key, :extended => true)

# Updates the document and tries to store it back.
beer["name"] = "Some other Name"
client.set(key, beer, :cas => cas, :flags => flags)
```

Note that this also means that all your application need to follow the same code
path (cooperative locking). If you use `#set` somewhere else in the code on the
same document, it will work even if the CAS itself is out of date (that’s
because the normal `#set` method doesn’t care about those values at all). Of
course, the CAS itself changes then and the mutation operation would fail
afterwards.

There is also shortcut operation for doing optimistic locking `Bucket#cas`.
Internally it does the same thing but abstract you from storing and passing meta
information. Here is the previous example rewritten to use this operation:


```ruby
key = "eagle_brewing-golden"
client.cas(key) do |beer|
beer["name"] = "Some other Name"
# return new value from block
beer
end
```

Note that you should return new value from the block. If you will skip it, it
will use `"Some other Name"` as new value.

### Pessimistic Locking

If you want to lock a document completely (or an object graph), you can use the
`Bucket#get` operation with `:lock` option. The option accepts either boolean
(where truth does make sense really) or Fixnum meaning the time period where the
lock is valid. The server will release lock after the that period (or maximum
value, which configured on the server). Other threads can still run `get`
queries queries against the document, but mutation operations without a CAS will
fail.

You can determine actual default and maximum values calling `Bucket#stats`
without arguments and inspecting keys `"ep_getl_default_timeout"` and
`"ep_getl_max_timeout"` correspondingly.


```ruby
key = "eagle_brewing-golden";

# Get with Lock
beer, flags, cas = client.get(key, :lock => true, :extended => true);

# Update the document
beer["name"] = "Some other Name"

# Try to set without the lock
client.set(key, beer, :flags => flags)
#=> will raise Couchbase::Error::KeyExists

# Try to set with the CAS aquired, will be OK
client.set(key, beer, :flags => flags, :cas => cas)
```

Once you update the document, the lock will be released. There is also the
`Bucket#unlock` method available through which you can unlock the document.

<a id="persistence_and_replication"></a>

### Persistence and Replication

By default, the mutation operations return when Couchbase Server has accepted
the command and stored it in memory (disk persistence and replication is handled
asynchronously by the cluster). That’s one of the reason why it’s so fast. For
most use-cases, that’s the behavior that you need. Sometimes though, you want to
trade in performance for data-safety and wait until the document has been saved
to disk and/or replicated to other hosts.

The Ruby SDK provides `:observe` option for all mutation operations. You can
claim various persistence conditions using this option. Basically its argument
is a Hash with three possible keys, describing the condition when the mutator
will yield the result:

 1. `:replicated` (Fixnum) describe how many nodes should receive replicated copy of
    the document.

 1. `:persisted` (Fixnum) describe how many nodes should persist the document to the
    disk. The nodes include master node, where the key resides and all replica
    nodes.

 1. `:timeout` (Fixnum) the timeout period in microseconds. After passing, the
    operation condition will be considered timed out and appropriate exception will
    be thrown. Default value could be addressed using
    `Bucket#default_observe_timeout`.

Here is an example on how to make sure that the document has been persisted on
its master node, but also replicated to at least one of its replicas.


```ruby
key = "important"
value = "document"
client.set(key, value, :observe => {:persisted => 1, :replicated => 1})
```

You can also separate persistence requirement from actual operations, and in
this case, you can wait for several keys:

```ruby
keys = []
(1..5).each do |nn|
key = "important-#{nn}"
keys << key
client.set(key, "document-#{nn}")
end
client.observe_and_wait(keys, :persisted => 1, :replicated => 1)
```
